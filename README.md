Aria_code.py is our final project that includes code from all three of us. It was called Aria_code because Aria was the first to upload and we never changed the name.
README.md is the file that contains documentation about each file in our repository.
commit.py is the first file that we used to test commiting to github.
skeleton.py is the skeleton that we made for our code for the project check in.
To run our program from the command line you put in the command python (python 3 if on mac) Aria_code.py the names of all three of your players. If the players want to use the optional paramater and set a win condition they can by doing -win_condition 4 (4 being an example of the specififed number). 
An example for running our program would be python aria_code.py veer alex aria -win_condition 3
The program itself has instructions when it starts running on how to play the game, but essentially it is just inputs of whether they would like to choose heads/tails and their selection of rock, paper, and or scisors whenever appropriate.
Aria: Set our global variables, created the class. Methods were __init__, playround, addcrown, __str__.
Veer: Did the parseargs function, the process_tile method, and the isgameover method.
Alex: Did the rock paper scisors method, the player move method, and the jackpot method.
